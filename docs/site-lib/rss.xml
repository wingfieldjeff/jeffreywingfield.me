When the sand runs out, you flip it over and the process repeats. This takes between 1 and 5 minutes. The problem, at least for me, is that it is fascinating for about a day before the friction of flipping over is just enough to leave it on a shelf and forget about it.Wouldn't it be cool if it flipped itself? What if it was more kinetic sculpture and less toy. It could be mounted on a wall, run all the time, and be different every time you look at it. The quickest thing I could come up with was essentially 2 plates with m3 bolts through them. One bolt had a bearing on it and the other had a plastic roller and stepper motor. An old arduino controls the stepper and a usbc breakout supplies 5v to both. This worked surprising well, so well that I fell for it. Thinking the job was done, I slapped it into a case that held the plates.<br>
