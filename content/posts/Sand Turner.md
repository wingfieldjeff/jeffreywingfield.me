# The Idea
I have this desk toy.

![[Pasted image 20250210210547.png]]Sand flows between bubbles, making patterns. When the sand runs out, you flip it over and the process repeats. This takes between 1 and 5 minutes. The problem, at least for me, is that it is fascinating for about a day before the friction of flipping over is just enough to leave it on a shelf and forget about it.

Wouldn't it be cool if it flipped itself? What if it was more kinetic sculpture and less toy. It could be mounted on a wall, run all the time, and be different every time you look at it. 

# First Swing
![[20250117_172519_1.mp4]]The quickest thing I could come up with was essentially 2 plates with m3 bolts through them. One bolt had a bearing on it and the other had a plastic roller and stepper motor. An old arduino controls the stepper and a usbc breakout supplies 5v to both. This worked surprising well, so well that I fell for it. Thinking the job was done, I slapped it into a case that held the plates.

I added some LEDs that brighten when the disk is moving and dim when it is not. I put a lid on it, plugged it in, and called it good.

It ran continuously for about a week before the plastic pins welded themselves into plastic holes and the motor siezed.
